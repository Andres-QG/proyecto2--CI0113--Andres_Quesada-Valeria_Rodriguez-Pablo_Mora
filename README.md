## Dots & Boxes

This game is for two players, the game starts with an empty grid of dots. The main idea is to take turns between the 2 players to draw a line between 2 two adjacent dots. The user can gain points if they complete a 1x1 box, the game ends if there are no more lines to be placed. The winner is the player with the most points.

More on the game can be seen in: [Dots & Boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_and_Boxes).

## **Minimax Algorithm**

This algorithm is used in artificial intelligence for making decisions minimizing the possible loss in the worst case scenario[Minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax). This algorithm uses a game-tree to obtain the best response. Minimax name is because of the two players that play the game, one is called MIN(minimized value) and the other MAX(maximized value).

This algorithm is used in games like Chess, Checkers, tic-tac-toe and go.
